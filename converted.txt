pistilliferous flowers (April to June)  The fruits have a fibrous mesocarp, woody endocarp and fleshy, oily seeds edible when ripe 
(September)  The parts used are the leaves, husks and edible seeds  Walnut has a bitter-tonic flavor and a warm, sweet odor 
Derivatives: The derivatives from leaves are decoction (5%), fluid extract, tincture (20% in 20% ethanol) and soft aqueous extract  
The derivatives from husks are fluid extract and petroleum ether fluid extract

Composition: The total oil content of walnut ranged from 62 6 to 70 3%, while the crude protein ranged from 13 6 to 18 1%  Dietary 
fiber ranged from 4 2 to 5 2%, while the starch content made up no more than 2 8% of the remaining portion of the kernel  The amino 
acid content of the walnuts was similar between cultivars and the patterns of essential amino acids were characteristic of a high qual-
ity protein * The immature fruit is one of the richest sources of ascorbic acid  The leaves, also rich in ascorbic acid (almost 1% of the 
weight), are rich in carotene (ca  0 3% wet weight)  Juglone is the active compound in the leaves; also quercetin, cyanadin, kaempferol, 
caffeic acid and traces of p-coumaric acid, hyperin (0 2%), quercitrin, kaempferol-3-arabinoside, quercetin-3-arabinoside  The seed 
oil contains 3 to 7% palmitic, 0 5 to 3% stearic, 9 to 30% oleic, 57 to 76% linoleic and 2 to 16% linolenic acids

Description: Wintergreen essential oil is water steam-distilled from leaves charged into the still and allowed to macerate for several 
hours to hydrolyze the gaultherin glucoside (methyl salicylate + glucose)  Distillation lasts from 5 to 6 hours and yields approximately 
0 7% essential oil  The oil is often adulterated by intentionally co-distilling sweet birth (Betula lenta) bark  FCC (1996) has described 
wintergreen oil as obtained from the leaves of G  procumbens and bark of B  lenta  The oil has a strong, sweet, aromatic odor remi-

Description: Woodruff sweet is a small, slightly sweet-scented perennial herb widespread throughout Europe and the Near East  It 
has very thin creeping rhizomes, both fertile and sterile stalks, and spear-like oblong leaves arranged about the central axis of the 
stalk (verticil) as spokes on a wheel  The verticils are spaced along the length of the stalk  The plant has terminal flowers (usually 
three) with white petals and blooms from June to July  The dried herb is commercially available throughout Europe  The whole plant 
is used  Sweet woodruff has a heavy, sweet, tobacco-like flavor and odor  The plant does not yield an essential oil upon steam distil-
lation  While the fresh plant is nearly odorless, it exhibits a coumarin-like fragrance when dried
